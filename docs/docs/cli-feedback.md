title: Gatsby CLI Feedback
---

Gatsby users will be prompted every 3 months (at the most) to give feedback to Gatsby on our products and services. This feedback is incredibly valuable and will help us shape Gatsby.

## How to opt-out

Users may always opt-out from the feedback prompts with `gatsby feedback --disable` or by setting the environment variable `GATSBY_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` to `1`
