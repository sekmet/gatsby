## Gatsby Themes and Starters

Here are the first party themes maintained by Gatsby.

The names tell you what they are: `gatsby-starter-*` vs `gatsby-theme-*`. For example:

- `gatsby-starter-blog-theme` is a starter that uses the blog theme and comes with demo content, etc. [Starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2) are a fairly common concept in the Gatsby ecosystem.
- `gatsby-theme-blog` is a theme that is released as an npm package. You can see this since the `package.json` name is `gatsby-theme-blog` as well.
